Here are my final conclusion
===============================

+ we have the over-fitting situation due to the sparse vector space.
the training error is zero but the testing error is more than 30%.
See BOW501-svmlinear-jan10.txt for more details.

+ your code is really junk and not usable. So try to improve it.
+ try to modularize the code to avoid error. 
See review1-tagging.R as an example of good coding.
